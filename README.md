A simple profile site about me.

## Technology Used

- [Remix](https://remix.run/docs) - Experimenting with Remix for building a simple React based app
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - For solid Type support
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Robust Atomic CSS framework

## Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

This starts the app in development mode, rebuilding assets on file changes.

## Deployment

First, build your app for production:

```sh
npm run build
```

Then run the app in production mode:

```sh
npm start
```

Now you'll need to pick a host to deploy it to.
